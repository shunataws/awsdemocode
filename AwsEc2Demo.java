 * Welcome to your new AWS Java SDK based project!
 *
 * This class is meant as a starting point for your console-based application that
 * makes one or more calls to the AWS services supported by the Java SDK, such as EC2,
 * SimpleDB, and S3.
 *
 * In order to use the services in this sample, you need:
 *
 *  - A valid Amazon Web Services account. You can register for AWS at:
 *       https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html
 *
 *  - Your account's Access Key ID and Secret Access Key:
 *       http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials
 *
 *  - A subscription to Amazon EC2. You can sign up for EC2 at:
 *       http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/
 *
 *  - A subscription to Amazon SimpleDB. You can sign up for Simple DB at:
 *       http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/
 *
 *  - A subscription to Amazon S3. You can sign up for S3 at:
 *       http://aws.amazon.com/s3/
